❤️ This is a data collection app, designed to look and feel as welcoming and enjayable as possible.

💜 There are two parts of this project:
  1. The game is designed to be as fun for the user as possible.
  2. The data collection system is made to use simple binary decisions by the users to derrive complex data about the population.
  
  
💙 To make the collected data more elaborate and timely, I used the ELO Rating system, used most popularly by tournament sports like chess and baseball.

💚 The app is made in Djnago, and hosted on Heroku.

💛 Feel free to look around and use any parts you like. Please mention any issues found.

Thank You!!
❤️💜💙💚💛
